        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives. I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.</li>
            <li>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.</li>
            <li>For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl. Mash together with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.</li>
        </ol>
