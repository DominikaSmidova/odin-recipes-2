        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Light, creamy, and refreshing, these easy DIY dreamsicles taste like nostalgia on a stick. The ice pops can also be made in paper cups instead of plastic popsicle molds, which can be cut away for easy release.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups orange sherbet, slightly softened</li>
            <li>2 cups vanilla ice cream, slightly softened</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh orange juice</li>
            <li>2/3 cup simple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sherbet and ice cream in a large ziplock plastic bag. Massage the bag to slightly mix the 2 colors. Make a 3/4-inch cut in the bottom corner of the bag. Squeeze about 3 tablespoons of sherbet mixture into each of 10 (3-oz) popsicle molds.</li>
            <li>Stir together orange juice, simple syrup, and cream in a liquid measuring cup. Pour juice mixture into popsicle molds allowing liquid to fill in any remaining air pockets of the ice cream. Insert popsicle sticks, and freeze for at least 8 hours.</li>
        </ol>
