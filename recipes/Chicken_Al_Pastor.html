            <li>2 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
            <li>6 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add dried chiles; cook, turning occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water to just cover the chiles, and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, 2/3 cup onion, orange juice, vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature while chicken marinates.</li>
        </ol>
